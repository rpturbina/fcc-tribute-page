                <ul>
                    <li><b>1936</b> - Born in Parepare, South Sulawesi</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>1960</b> - Received an engineer's degree in Germany
                        with the title Diplom-Ingenieur. He remained in Germany
                        as a research assistant under Hans Ebner at the
                        Lehrstuhl und Institut für Leichtbau, RWTH Aachen to
                        conduct research for his doctoral degree.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>1962</b> - Returned to Indonesia for three months on
                        sick leave. During this time, he was reacquainted with
                        Hasri Ainun, the daughter of R. Mohamad Besari. Habibie
                        had known Hasri Ainun in childhood, junior high school
                        and in senior high school at SMA Kristen Dago (Dago
                        Christian Senior High School), Bandung. The two married
                        on 12 May 1962, returning to Germany shortly afterwards
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>1963</b> - Habibie and his wife settled in Aachen for
                        a short period before moving to Oberforstbach. In May
                        1963 they had a son, Ilham Akbar Habibie.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>1965</b> - Habibie delivered his dissertation in
                        aerospace engineering and received the grade of "very
                        good," giving him the title Doktoringenieur (Dr.-Ing.).
                        The same year, he accepted Hans Ebner's offer to
                        continue his research on Thermoelastisitas and work
                        toward his Habilitation, but he declined the offer to
                        join RWTH as a professor. His thesis about light
                        construction for supersonic or hypersonic states also
                        attracted offers of employment from companies such as
                        Boeing and Airbus, which Habibie again declined.

                        Indonesia as part of his drive to industrialize and
                        develop the country. Habibie initially served as a
                        special assistant to Ibnu Sutowo, chief executive
                        officer of the state oil company Pertamina and Chair of

                        changed its name to Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara
                        (Nusantara Aircraft Industry; also abbreviated as IPTN)
                        and is known as Indonesian Aerospace (PT. Dirgantara

                    <li>
                        <b>1978</b> - he was appointed as State Minister of
                        Research and Technology (Indonesian: Menteri Negara
                        Riset dan Teknologi, Menristek). He continued to play an
                        important role in IPTN other "strategic" industries in
                        this post.

                    <li>
                        <b>1980s</b> - IPTN had grown considerably, specializing
                        in the manufacture of helicopters and small passenger
                        planes. Under Habibie's leadership, IPTN became a
                        manufacturer of aircraft including Puma helicopters and
                        CASA planes. It pioneered a small passenger airplane,
                        the N-250 Gatotkaca, in 1995, but the project was a
                        commercial failure.

                    <li>
                        <b>1991</b> - Habibie oversaw ten state-owned industries
                        including ship- and train-building, steel, arms,

                        <b>1998</b> - After accepting nomination for a seventh
                        term as President, Suharto announced the selection
                        criteria for the nomination of a vice president. Suharto
                        did not mention Habibie by name, but his suggestion that
                        the next vice president should have a mastery of science
                        and technology made it obvious he had Habibie in mind.

                        <b>1998</b> - Habibie, as the Constitution says,
                        succeeded him as president. The following day, Habibie
                        announced the Development Reform Cabinet, which removed
                        some of the most controversial ministers in Suharto's
                        last cabinet while maintaining others - with no major
                        figures from the opposition. Within days of his
                        appointment, he asked his relatives to resign from
                        government positions, promised an early election,
                        repealed some legislation, and ordered the release of
                        political prisoners.
